"""
Ensemble Models - deploy multiple model in real time and serve them in real time
option 1 - one large model with slower response times
Option 2 - multiple smaller models - faster, easier to fine tune & same performance

Ensemble Prob = ( M1_prb + M2_prob + M3_prob ......) / n

combination of models which are not highly corelated works 
better than cmbination of models which are correlated to each other
